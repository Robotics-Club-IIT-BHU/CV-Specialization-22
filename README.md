# Computer Vision Specialization- Robo Summer Camp '22
Welcome to the Computer Vision Specialization offered by Robo Summer Camp. For the following few weeks, we'll learn how a robot *sees*. And guys it's not just a camera, but a lot of hidden algorithms and concepts are required to make sense of the images that a robot gets from the camera.</br>
The course would be divided into 3 parts weekwise. -</br>
- **Part-1 Introduction to ML** </br>
You will learn some basic Machine Learning concepts and algorithms required to build your understanding for the computer vision specialisation.
- **Part-2 Introduction to Basic Deep Learning/ Computer Vision Architectures** </br>
Introduction to basic computer vision architectures including a classification algorithm and CNN architecture. 
- **Part-3 Some Advanced Computer Vision concepts and algorithms** </br>
We'll make you familiar to the concept of Transfer Learning and some advanced algorithms like UNET and YOLO
