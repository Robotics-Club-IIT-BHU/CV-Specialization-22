# Welcome to Week-3 of CV Specialization

This week you will be learning about Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection. These are two well known tasks of computer vision which are widely used in many robotics.

Object Detection - Here we try to detect different types of objects in real time camera images or videos. Some commonly used computer vision algorithms for this task are YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster RCNN (Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks). You can see a basic implementation below:

Semantic Segmentation - Here we try to segment out each different type of object present in an image or video. Commonly used network for this task is UNet. Below you can see an example of semantic segmentation:
